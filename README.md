# Movie-App
A Movie App using Laravel, Tailwind CSS and The Movie DB REST API. I go over the different architecture options and the different popular technologies around the Laravel/Vue community. I'll be making use of several Laravel 7 features like the HTTP Client and Blade Components. I then style my application with the latest version of Tailwind CSS, using new features like CSS Grid and CSS Transitions.
